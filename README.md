## 🧩 Problem Statement
Retail companies often deal with large volumes of sales data across different regions, products, and time periods.  
However, this raw data is difficult to interpret without proper visualization.

Because of that, managers struggle to:
- Identify which products or regions drive the most revenue 🛍️  
- Understand customer purchasing patterns 👥
